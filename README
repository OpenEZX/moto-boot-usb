boot_usb was designed to communicate with the bootloader of EZX phones. It is
part of the OpenEZX project (http://www.openezx.org/) and only useful for
Motorola EZX linux phones.

This program allows you to download an execute code on the phone ram.

It allows you to test a kernel zImage without flashing it into your phone. You
need to enter the bootloader mode of the EZX phone before the program can
communicate with the phone:

EZX first generation: (Blue bootloder screen will come up)
A780:		press camera and jogdial(scrollwheel) button while power on.
E680(i):	press camera and volume down button while power on.

EZX second generation: (Red bootloader screen will come up)
ROKR E2:	press the voicedial button while power on.
A1200:		press voicedial button while power on.
ROKR E6:	press the camera button while power on.
A910:		press the voicedial button while power on.

MOTOMAGX: (Black bootloader screen will come up)
RAZR2 V8:	press '*' and '#' buttons while power on.

For the MOTOMAGX phone we are able to transfer a kernel put not able to execute
it as it fails a signature check.

If your EZX phone is not listed here you have perhaps more luck on our wiki:
